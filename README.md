# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Using-Keras

This repository includes the requirements for Facial Expression Recognition using keras and the dataset for processing and obtaining the model.
It also contains my certificate of completion of this guided project from Coursera.

SUMMARY:
Recognition of facial expressions- Using Convolutional Neural Networks to build and train the model for facial recognition and deploy the trained model to a web interface with flask, which can be applied to real-time video streams and images.
